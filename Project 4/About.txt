=======================================================
Author : Devin Upreti

1. Project 4 pulls all the necessary parts for 
   Remote Code into a single solution:
   - GUI client
   - UnitTest(Server)
   - MsgPassingComm
   - NoSqlDb
   Some supporting actors are used as well:
   - CommLibWrapper
   - DateTime
   - DbCore
   - FileSystem
   - PayLoad
   - Sockets
   - Translater
   - Utilities
   - XmlDocument
2. This is a complete solution for the Project #4 Requirements.
3. There are Tabs:
   - Local to show client files and directories.
   - Remote to show server files and directories.
   - Connect to demonstrate asynchronous message communication.
   - Query to as a way for you to browse selected contents of the db.
   - About displays the text of this file.
3. What it does do:
   - Shows local and remote directories and files.
   - Double-clicking on a directory navigates into that directory
     and shows its contents for both the local and remote locations.
   - CheckIn click on a file in local navigator will send the file 
     from the client to server.  And the Server ChecksIn the file into
	 the Server Repository.
   - CheckOut click on a file in remote navigator will send the file 
     from the server to client and ChecksOut the file.
   - The client can also browse queries using the Query tab.

4. There is also a grid row on the main display which is used as
   a status bar.
